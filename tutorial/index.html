    <h2> Explore the Code</h2>

    <p>You've just created a Scala application! Â This is a basic "Hello, World"
       application.   Let's look at the <a href="#code/src/main/scala/Hello.scala"
      class="shortcut">src/main/scala/Hello.scala</a> file.</p>

    <p>This file consists of a single object called <code>Hello</code>.  This
       object defines a <code>main</code> method, which denotes that it can be run as a
       standalone application.  Let's look into the definition of the main method:</p>
<pre><code>def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = </code></pre>
    <p> The method definition starts with the keyword "<code>def</code>".   This is used to define all
       methods in scala.  After def comes the name of the method, in this case "main".</p>
    <p>Following the name is the argument list, denoting input parameters to the method.  In
       the case of the "<code>main</code>" method, it takes a single parameter called "<code>args</code>".
       When the application is executed, any command line arguments will be bundled into an array 
       of string values (or "<code>Array[String]</code>") and passed into the "<code>main</code>" method.</p>
    <p>Following the argument list is the return type of the method.  For main, this is "<code>Unit</code>" which
       denotes "uninteresting" return type.   It is similar to the "void" type of Java/C/C++ in that we aren't
       interesting in calling the "<code>main</code>" method for a return value.
    <p>Following the return type is an "<code>=</code>" character and then the method implementation.
       For the <code>Hello.main</code> method, the implementation is the following block of code:
    </p>
    <pre><code>{
  println("Hello, World")
}</code></pre>

    <p>This block of code uses the <code>println</code> method to display the string
       literal "Hello, world!" on the console.  We can see this output by
       clicking on the <a class="shortcut" href="#run">Run</a> tab.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2> Running Applications</h2>

    <p>The result of running the <code>Hello</code> application is shown in the 
        <a href="#run" class="shortcut">Run</a> tab.  On the left-hand side we can
        see the console output, which is "Hello, world!" for the <code>Hello</code>
        application.</p>

    <p>Let's make changes to the <code>Hello</code> application and see what happens.</p>

    <p>First, go back to <a href="#code/src/main/scala/Hello.scala"
       class="shortcut">Hello.scala</a> and change 
       <pre><code>println("Hello, world!")</code></pre> 
       to 
       <pre><code>println("Hello, Activator!")</code></pre> 
       and select "Save".</p>
    <p>Now, come back to the <a href="#run" class="shortcut">Run</a> tab.  After
       recompiling and running the project, you should see the console output now
       shows: <pre><code>Hello, Activator!</code></pre></p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Defining Values</h2>

    <p>Let's go back to <a href="#code/src/main/scala/Hello.scala" class="shortcut">Hello.scala</a>
       and start mucking with the code.</p>

    <p>First, we'd like to have our application also say goodbye.   Let's add the
       following line to the end of the Hello main method's body:
    <p>
    <pre><code>println("Goodbye, Activator!")</pre></code>

    <p>Save the file and then navigate back to the <a href="#run" class="shortcut">Run</a> tab, and you should see:</p>

<pre><code>Hello, Activator!
Goodbye, Activator!</pre></code>

    <p> Now, we'd like to re-use the name for the greeting and farewell text.  To do so, we're going to use a <code>def</code> in Scala.
       A <code>def</code> denotes a method, or block of re-usable code.  Let's modify our <a href="#code/src/main/scala/Hello.scala" class="shortcut">Hello</a> src/main/scala as follows:
    </p>
<pre><code>
object Hello {
  val who = "Activator"

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    println("Hello, " + who + "!")
    println("Goodbye, " + who + "!")
  }
}
</code></pre>
    <p>This new code creates a <code>val</code> called "<code>who</code>" which is used in the greeting messages.  After defining the value, everytime the "<code>who</code>" name is referenced, the value we've stored will be used.</p>
    <p>The <code>+</code> operator is used to join the necessary strings together before passing to the <code>println</code> method.  If we swap back to the <a href="#run" class="shortcut">Run</a> tab, we'll see that the greeting and goodbye messages remain unchanged.
    </p>
    <p>In Scala, a "val" represents a re-usable piece of data or computation that we do not want to re-run.   Once set, a val points to the same information forever.  In
       other words, it is immutable.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Testing Applications</h2>

    <p>No app, regardless of how simple, is complete without a modicum of testing!   Let's modify our existing tests to account for the new "<code>who</code>" method we've added.</p>

     <p>Navigate to <a href="#code/src/test/scala/HelloSpec.scala" class="shortcut">HelloSpec.scala</a> to see our existing test suite.  You should see the following:</p>
     <pre><code>
import org.scalatest._
import org.scalatest.matchers.ShouldMatchers

class HelloSpec extends FlatSpec with ShouldMatchers {
  "Hello" should "have tests" in {
    true should be === true
  }
}
</pre></code>

     <p>Let's ignore the imports and class definition for now, and focus on the test itself.   This test is using the <a href="http://scalatest.org" target="_blank">scalatest library</a>.
        Scalatest provides an elegant way of writing unit tests in Scala.   For our purposes, we're using it to define tests of the hello world application.   Currently, 
        we have one test:</p>
<pre><code>true should be === true</pre></code>
      <p> This test is nested in the categorization/label:</p>
<pre><code>"Hello" should "have tests"</pre></code>    
      <p>While it's true that we should have tests in our Hello world application, a test that true is true isn't particularly helpful.  Let's define a test using the new "who"
      value in the the Hello object.  Modify the test as follows:</p>
<pre><code>
  "Hello" should "know who to greet" in {
    Hello.who should be === "Activator"
  }
</pre></code>

    <p>Save this new test, and make sure it runs.   You can see the testing output on the <a href="#test" class="shortcut">Test</a> tab.  Test results are updated automatically
       after saving a source file, and the build is finished rebuilding your project.</p>

    <p>The new test should show up on the list of tests with the name "Hello should know who to greet", and it should be passing.</p>

    <p>If we take a closer look in the <a href="#code/src/test/scala/HelloSpec.scala" class="shortcut">code</a>, we're accessing the member "who" on the "Hello" object using the "." notation.  In Scala, we can reference any member on an 
       object using that object's name, the ".", and the name of the member.</p>

    <p>Now that we've define a single test, it's time to dig further into the Scala language.</p>

    <h2>Next Steps</h2>

    <p>You're now ready to really start learning how to write application in Scala!   While this tutorial presents the absolute basics of creating application in Scala,
       we don't cover the details of the language.  As you explore further tutorials, we recommend toying with code inside of Activator.  You may continue using the browser, 
       or swap to a command line experience via the "activator" script in the hello-scala directory.</p>
